* This is a hacked around version of the Talkie Speech Synthesis library,    *

* Speech sounds here are extracts from the Acorn Computers BBC Microcomputer *
* Speech Synthesiser upgrade. This was famous at the time as the first ever  *
* computer voice with an english accent. It was voiced by Kenneth Kendall,   *
* a BBC newsreader of the era.                                               *

* Talkie is designed for a 16MHz clocked device. Unfortunately SolderTime is *
* running at 8MHz, so the core synthesis code needs extra speed tweaks to    *
